In this repository you will find all necessary files to build your a resumé app using streamlit. 

The webapp is not optimized for mobile use. Best display is achieved by  viewing this app over your laptop or desktop pc. 

Currently, the webapp consists of the following 6 pages: 

1. Home (Introduction - about me)
2. Resumé (downloadable as pdf)
3. Machine Learning Projects (here I will download ML experience I am gaining)
4. SAC Demo (I used to work as a dashboard developer using the BI Tool SAP Analytics Cloud, here you find a brief demo what the tool looks like)
5. My Hobbies
6. QR Code for easy access
